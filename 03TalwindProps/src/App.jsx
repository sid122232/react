Elementary algebra generalizes arithmetic by using variables in addition to numbers. It covers methods of transforming equations to solve them by isolating variables. Linear algebra examines systems of several linear equations and techniques to determine for which values all equations in a system are true at the same time. Abstract algebra investigates algebraic structures, which consist of a set of objects together with operations defined on that set. It distinguishes algebraic structures, such as groups, rings, and fields, based on their number of operations and the laws they follow. Algebraic methods were first studied in ancient times to solve specific problems. As algebra evolved, it became increasingly abstract and generalized, leading to many applications in other branches of mathematics and the empirical sciences.' author ='SID' title='FULL STACK DEVELOPER'/>
